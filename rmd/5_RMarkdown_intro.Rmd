## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
iris[1:2, 2:3]
```

円周率は`r pi`です。

```{r}
head(iris)
```

```{r}
df <- head(iris)
knitr::kable(df)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(plotly)
```


```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~ Species, y = ~ Sepal.Length, type = "box")
```
